# Prework Study Guide

## Description
This project was an example of how to use several coding languages including, HITML, CSS, and Javascript. I created a Prework Study Guide for the upcoming coding bootcamp, I used coding to help create a webpage that will help me with upcoming projects. It taught me the basics of 3 languages to help guide me towards the path of learning. I learned many different rules and basic ways to utilize these languages to code.

## Usage
   
This study guide will provide basic insight into each language we have learned thus far, it provides
notes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It gives an idea into how the code interacts with the webpage and the developer console within google chrome. It was designed as a testing ground to practice different basic techniques and see them applied. It was ultimately very useful to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while being introduced to these languages.
